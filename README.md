## Introduction to study
Our study tests how AMF colonisation and other physiological root traits respond to fire frequency in herbaceous plant species from Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minnesota, USA. We qualitatively assess the collaboration â€“ conservation gradient by investigating how mycorrhizal colonisation, as well as relevant physiological root traits (specific root length, root tissue density, average root diameter) changes across the fire frequency gradient. We hypothesise that an increase in fire frequency will lead to an increase in light availability, and a decrease in soil phosphorous and inorganic nitrogen availability. This results in a situation where soil nutrients become the factor limiting plant growth rate, leading plants to invest root resources along the conservation (low root tissue density, low root diameter, high specific root length, low AMF colonisation) or collaboration (high root tissue density, high fine root diameter, low specific root length, high AMF colonisation). We hypothesise that plants choose the collaboration strategy in most environmental conditions due to higher resource acquisition efficiency than investing in fine roots (Graphical Abstract). Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve is a long-term ecological research site, which has been investigating the effect of fire on plant communities by implementing controlled burns of six different fire frequencies in 12 different burn unit sites since the 1960s. 

To quantify AMF colonisation, we used a modified staining method using trypan blue and observed fungal structures under a light microscope. In total, 61 individuals were screened, 33 individuals were observed, totalling 33 slides, 330 root sections, and 19,800 observations of AMF structures. Due to methodological limitations, AMF data was obtained from 17 out of the original 33 individuals, totalling 8 species and 6 fire frequencies. During the protocol modification stage, an extra 22 slides were mounted, totalling 110 root sections. Due to the statistical limitations of the small sample size as a result of difficult staining protocol, we also analysed two larger datasets. A larger dataset containing 28 individuals was analysed for how physiological root traits change across the fire gradient, and larger datasets obtained from the literature were used to investigate how soil phosphorous and inorganic nitrogen change across the fire gradient, as fire is known to influence the availability of soil nutrients provided by AMF. We found that fire frequency is correlated with increased AMF colonisation in all functional groups and species studied, which is consistent with current ecological theory on plant growth strategies.
